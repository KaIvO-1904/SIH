# Gram-AI: Geospatial Rural Advisory & Micro-enterprise Intelligence

## Project Overview
Gram-AI is an AI-driven hyper-local business advisory and financial structuring assistant designed specifically for rural micro-entrepreneurs. Unlike generic chatbots, Gram-AI focuses on **Business Viability Before Financing**, helping entrepreneurs determine if a business idea is viable in their specific locality before recommending government schemes and financing options.
